- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

For the House class, I decided to overload the constructor, creating two alternative houses with different intended purposes. The first overloaded constructor, taking a name, address, and number of floors, is intended to represent the conversion of a random building into a house, as it takes all of the methods and functionality a typical building at Smith would have, but turns it into a house. The second overloaded constructor takes only a name and the number of floors, and is intended as a constructor for creating a house that has yet to be built, so may not have an address yet. I decided to overload the constructor in this way because I thought it would be fun.

For the Cafe class, I overloaded the constructor to create a simple cafe with one floor, a given name and address, and a set amount of stock inventory. This would make it simple for a person new to opening cafes to get started. I also overloaded the sellCoffee() method in order to make a typical coffee order. I wanted to do this to in some way mimic a regular coming in and asking for their "usual".

For the Library class I overloaded the constructor to create a library from a random unspecified building with no address one floor and no elevator because this is kind of what the little free libraries are like that I see around my neighborhood at home. I also overloaded the addTitle() method to allow the user to enter the title after they decide they would like to make the request, such as how it might work if someone were to ask a library to add one of their own books to the collection.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I started tinkering around with how to create an interactive map for this project, however I wasn't able to figure it out by the due date, so I was wondering if you could show me a basic implementation for how to do this.
